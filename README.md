Phishing site to pretend to be an official service provider to steal user credentials

Phishing scams usually start as a person pretending to be from a service provider, and getting the user to feel an urgency to resolve a problem
it might be an email, a phone call etc. once the user clicks on the link they are redirected to a fake site, the user should always check the domain name
and the link URL before clicking to make sure it's from the legit domain.

These sites usually look official, but their domain names aka URL link gives them away. the purpose of these sites are to trick the user into entering their
login credentials and the owner of the site would steal that login info.

There are tools and software out there that hackers & scammers can use to clone a site for example i used HTTracker in this example to clone Facebook and then
i can go into the site code and modify where the login data is sent example <form method="POST" action="steal.php"> once the user hits the submit button i have
their login.
